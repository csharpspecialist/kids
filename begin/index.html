<h1>  Start here!!    </h1>

I used Notepad++ to create this document/website. </br>

In order to preview what you have just typed choose the "Run" tab and then choose
whicever browser you want to preview your code.   </br>

 If you want to change the background color then go to Settings > Style configurator > 
 
 Select theme.   </br> I choose Monokai because I like a black background with white letters button
 
 you can choose anyone that you likefrom the select theme dropdown menu.

   </br>
 I also put a program in your documents folder name "Teamview 8".
 
 This will allow me to view your screen if you want me to give you pointers with your
 
 code.     </br>
 
 The pic on the left below shows the screen you should get to just by double clicking the teamviewer 8 icon.</br>
 
  MAKE SURE THAT YOU CHOOSE "RUN ONLY!!!!" & PERSONAL/NON-COMMERCIAL. </br>
 
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO INSTALL THIS PROGRAM FOR IT TO WORK!!!!  </br>
 
 You would then give your ID and password to whomever you would like to view your screen...  </br>
 
 Don't worry...in order for someone to take over your system they must have the ID and password
 and they would have to be using teamview...plus then it would prompt you to give them control.
